I have to say that I like the direction that he is going with it and I hope that he continues producing great screen casts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After watching the video, however, I noticed some of the comments that were made by others and started to get really frustrated over how developers
view unit testing and practicing TDD.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I am not saying that I am the end-all-be-all when it comes to unit testing and TDD.

test and instead relied on firing up a browser and stepping through the application to &amp;ldquo;test&amp;rdquo; the code.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

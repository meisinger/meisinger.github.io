Setting up and configuring a VM with a Host Only Network to run headless is something that I feel like I can do in my sleep.
The one thing that was a constant pain, however, was keeping the VM up to date (with as small of a footprint possible) and keeping everything organized.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those who aren’t familiar with &lt;a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox&lt;/a>, it is general purpose virtualization manager that can run on fairly limited hardware.
If you are like me and can’t afford a VMWare installation and just want to standup a virtual machine quickly, VirtualBox is a fast a simple way to get started.
Just like any other operating system, however, it is up to you to keep things in order and up to date.
Taking snapshots, managing network interfaces, managing disk space, images, etc.
This is an invaluable learning experience but after a while it gets a little long in the tooth.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

&lt;p>I updated &lt;a href="https://github.com/psake/psake">psake&lt;/a> from version 0.22 to version 4.3.1.0.
Now I don’t know about you but that is a significant jump in version number. After the update, no problems.
I actually find it easier to deal with and have come to the realization that I should revisit the existing tasks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then went ahead and update &lt;a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit">xUnit&lt;/a> from version 1.1.0 to version 1.9.2.
After the update I had a significant number of build errors. All of the build errors were concerning the &lt;code>Assert.Throws&lt;/code> extension method.
In the old version this method had an overload that took a “message” as a parameter.
In the latest version this overload was removed.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

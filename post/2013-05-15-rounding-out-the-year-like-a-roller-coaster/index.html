2 minute read</h6></section><section class=content><p>In my last post I state that I was starting over. As I wrote that post I never would have imagined that I would have the year like I did.
Sure, starting in the “ground” floor is a bummer but, you lace up the boot straps and meet the situation head on.
What I wasn’t expecting, however, were the ups and downs that I experienced through out the year.</p><p>With it being a little over a year since, things have improved. Most notably, the time I have been spending with my family have been very rewarding.
I have also found a good balance between family time, personal time and work. I am very fortunate to have a family who understand that I am passionate
about software development. And recently my “work life” has been improving. Unfortunately (depending on the perspective) the software developer in me
has been itching to do more.</p><p>This “itch” has been scratched through a few deep dives into RabbitMQ, Redis and consistent hashing algorithms.
My experiences with Redis has lead me to write my own client. Like many others I have used the ServiceStack Redis client.
After looking at the code and attempting to do a few specific things, however, I became a little frustrated.
That’s not to say that the ServiceStack Redis client is bad but does too many things and promotes concepts that I do not subscribe to.
One day soon I will have to push the code up to GitHub. Perhaps one day soon.</p><p>All and all, it appears as though this year is turning out to be much better. The beginning of the year has been great.
I feel like there is something around the corner that will soon make my summer even better.</p><p><em>Really trying hard not to jinx things.</em></p></section><section class=footer><div class=categories><label>Categories:</label><div data-type=taxonomy><a href=/categories/life title=Life>Life</a></div></div><h6 data-label=meta>Posted on Wednesday, May 15, 2013</h6></section><section class=navigation><a href=/post/2012-02-14-starting-over/>Previous

It has been a while since I last posted anything.

During this hiatus I have been working on several things that have been really interesting. 
Unfortunately none of which has been in the .Net world. Yup... you guessed it, I have been off working in the Java world for the last year. 
And while I kept up with the going's on in the .Net world (or at least tried too), 
there was never enough time to keep my head wrapped around the Java work while continuing to dive into my beloved .Net world.

Now that my hiatus is coming to a close, I am looking forward to taking deeper dives into some of the newer frameworks and technologies that have been introduced lately.

title: Rhino Mocks New Home
---

I am proud to state that Rhino Mocks has a new home. I must admit that I am feeling a little nervous. 
Its not every day that you get take charge of a project like Rhino Mocks.

There are some plans to modify the code based on the original “4.0” roadmap from a few years ago but the initial 
focus will be to create a single location to download the binaries. Once this is established then things like “alpha” and “beta” builds can be done. 
I also believe strongly in documenting the features that are currently available. 
Perhaps a wiki or website can be created to help out in this area (especially for some of the more complex features). 
Along the same line, another primary focus will be to promote the principles behind Rhino Mocks. In other words, answering the “why” versus the “how" questions.

I would like to thank Ayende for giving me this opportunity. 
I look forward to the challenge and serving the community. 
Hopefully you will join me on the adventure.

Well, we've been here before.

I've actually been here for the last twenty years.
Not doing the same exact thing over that time but oddly similar.

We have a tendency to rely on what we have learned in the past to help guide us into the future.

New things can be scary. Especially when we have nothing to base the new thing off of from our past.

In those scenarios, we sometimes fail.

If you learn from your failures then your future opens up as it is now a part of your past.

In those scenarios, failure is an option.

The sage was right, "Do. Or Do Not. There is no try."
Don't just try something new. Do something new.
